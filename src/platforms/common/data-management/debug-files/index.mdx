---

Debug information files allow Sentry to extract stack traces and provide more
information about crash reports for most compiled platforms. Information stored
in debug files includes original function names, paths to source files and line
numbers, source code context, or the placement of variables in memory. Sentry
displays this information on the Issue Details page to help you triage an issue.

<PlatformSection notSupported={["native.wasm", "javascript.wasm"]}>

Each major platform uses different debug information files. We currently support
the following formats:

- _<PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/file-formats/#mach-o-and-dsym">dSYM files</PlatformLink>_ for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, and macOS
- _<PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/file-formats/#executable-and-linkable-format-elf">ELF symbols</PlatformLink>_ for Linux and Android (NDK)
- _<PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/file-formats/#pe-and-pdb">PDB files</PlatformLink>_ for Windows
- _<PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/file-formats/#breakpad-symbols">Breakpad symbols</PlatformLink>_ for all
  platforms
- _<PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/file-formats/#wasm">WASM files</PlatformLink>_for WebAssembly
- _<PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/file-formats/#proguard-mappings">ProGuard mappings</PlatformLink>_ for Java and Android

</PlatformSection>

<Note>

Source maps, while also being debug information files, are handled
differently in Sentry. For more information see [Source Maps in sentry-cli](/product/cli/releases/#sentry-cli-sourcemaps).

</Note>

Sentry requires access to debug information files of your application as well as
system libraries to provide fully symbolicated crash reports. You can either
[upload](./upload/) your files to Sentry or put them on a compatible
[Symbol Server](./symbol-servers/) to be downloaded by Sentry when needed.

Debug information files can be managed on the _Debug Files_ section in _Project
Settings_. This page lists all uploaded files and allows you to configure symbol
servers for automatic downloads.

ProGuard files can be managed on the _ProGuard_ section in _Project
Settings_. This page lists all uploaded files.
