Sentry’s Next.js SDK is enabled by default in production environments. This default mode is because Next.js’ development mode doesn’t perform some checks as it does in production mode during the build process. As a result, some errors may not be caught (including these that would prevent a successful build) and the SDK may not behave as expected.

## Enabling the SDK in development

You can enable the SDK in other environments, such as development; however, enabling the SDK in development doesn’t change its behavior.

```javascript {filename:next.config.js}
module.exports = {
    serverRuntimeConfig: {
        sentry: {
            enableInDev: true,
        }
    },
    publicRuntimeConfig: {
        sentry: {
            enableInDev: true,
        }
    }
}
```

<Note>

Don’t forget to add `enableInDev` in both configurations.
