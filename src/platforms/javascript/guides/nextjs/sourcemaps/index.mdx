Sentry supports un-minifying JavaScript via source maps, which lets us view source code context obtained from stack traces in their original untransformed form. This is particularly useful for debugging minified code (for example, UglifyJS), or transpiled code from a higher-level language (such as TypeScript and ES6).

<Note>

Sentry will automatically fetch the source code and source maps by scraping the URLs within the stack trace. However, you may have legitimate reasons for [disabling the JavaScript source fetching in Sentry](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/07/17/source-code-fetching).

## Capturing Source Maps

If we have chosen to automatically configure the SDK (and not changed the default configuration), Source Maps are already being captured in build time and sent to Sentry.

If this is not the case, or want to have a custom config, we can edit the [default config](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/#manual-configuration) in the `next.config.js`.
Source Maps are captured by adding the [`sentry-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin) (installed along with the SDK) to the config plugins in the `next.config.js` file.
