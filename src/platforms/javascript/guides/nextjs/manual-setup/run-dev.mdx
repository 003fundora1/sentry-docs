Next.js’ development mode doesn’t perform some checks the production mode does during the build process, and there may be errors that aren’t caught (including these that would prevent a successful build) and make the SDK not behave as expected.
Thus, the Next.js SDK is only enabled by default in production environments.

## Enabling the SDK in development

You may want to enable the SDK in other environments like development. However, note that enabling the SDK in development doesn’t change its behavior.

```javascript {filename:next.config.js}
module.exports = {
    serverRuntimeConfig: {
        sentry: {
            dev: true,
        }
    },
    publicRuntimeConfig: {
        sentry: {
            dev: true,
        }
    }
}
```

<Note>

Don’t forget to add `dev` in both configurations.
