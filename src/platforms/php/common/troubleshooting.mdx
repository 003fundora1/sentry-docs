## Why are the variables missing in PHP event stack traces?

This is caused by the PHP configuration. PHP 7.4 introduced a new .ini setting, `zend.exception_ignore_args`, that will ignore stack trace args by default. Please check your .ini file to ensure this setting is turned on, as it is off by default.
