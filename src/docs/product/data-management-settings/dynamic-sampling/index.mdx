Dynamic sampling addresses the need to easily change and manage what is sampled after an application is deployed. In addition, dynamic sampling enables more sophisticated sampling decisions that span multiple transactions.

When you select your sampling type, you'll find that dynamic sampling:

- prioritizes impactful data
- enables observation of complete traces
- maintains a representative sample
- requires minimal configuration and no redeployment

## Sampling Types

Sentry offers the ability to sample in two different ways. You can sample [client-side in your SDK](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/sampling/#configuring-the-transaction-sample-rate) during SDK initialization or by [setting dynamic sampling rates](TODO: add link to new content) in Filters & Sampling for your Project in sentry.io. Learn more about our [Sampling Types and the benefits of each](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/sampling-types/).

## Dynamic Sampling Operations

Dynamic sampling operates on both error events and transaction events. When creating rules for transactions, you can further determine whether to apply dynamic sampling rules to transactions independently or as part of a trace. Learn more about [how the rules are applied](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/operations/).

## Example

Determining which type of dynamic sampling to set varies based on what you're trying to accomplish. Review our [comprehensive example](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/example/) that illustrates when different sampling methods might be useful.
