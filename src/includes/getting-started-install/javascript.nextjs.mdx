Add the `@sentry/nextjs` dependency:

```npm
npm install --save @sentry/nextjs
```

```yarn
yarn add @sentry/nextjs
```

### Setup

The call to the [Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will automatically patch your project accordingly, though you can [setup manually](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/manual-config/) if you prefer.
It will perform the following changes:

- create `next.config.js` with the default configuration (if it already exists it will be `_next.config.js` instead, which will need to be merged manually).
- create `sentry.properties` with Sentryâ€™s project-specific data.

```Npx
npx sentry-wizard -i nextjs
```

```Yarn
yarn sentry-wizard -i nextjs
```
