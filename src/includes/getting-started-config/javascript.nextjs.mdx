If you’ve set up the project automatically with the wizard, your app is already configured with the basic `Sentry.init`, in different configuration files. You can edit these files to configure the SDK.

The client:

```javascript {filename:sentry.client.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

const SENTRY_DSN = process.env.SENTRY_DSN || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN;

Sentry.init({
  dsn: SENTRY_DSN || "___DSN___",
  // ...
});
```

And the server:

```javascript {filename:sentry.server.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

const SENTRY_DSN = process.env.SENTRY_DSN || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN;

Sentry.init({
  dsn: SENTRY_DSN || "___DSN___",
  // ...
});
```

<Note>

Next.js’ development mode doesn’t perform some checks as it does in production mode during the build process.
As a result, the SDK may not behave as expected by not catching some errors.
You can get rid of them by building your app.
