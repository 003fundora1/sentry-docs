To initialize the SDK, you need to call `Sentry.init` as in every other SDK, but in separate configuration files for the client and the server:

```javascript {filename:sentry.client.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  // ...
});
```

And the server:

```javascript {filename:sentry.server.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  // ...
});
```
