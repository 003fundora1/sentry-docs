To initialize the SDK, you only need to import it:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';
```

Unlike other Sentry SDKs, the Next.js SDK doesnâ€™t have to be initialized in code, since we do it for you.
If you want to customize the initialization, see [Custom initialisation](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/custom-init/).
