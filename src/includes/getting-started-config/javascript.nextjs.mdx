To initialize the SDK, you need only to import it:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';
```

Unlike other Sentry SDKs, the Next.js SDK doesnâ€™t have to be initialized in code, since we do it for you.
If you prefer, you can [customize the initialization](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/custom-init/).
