Our Django integration provides the following features:

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported.
- Each request has a separate scope.
- The Sentry Python SDK attaches SQL queries as [breadcrumbs](/platforms/python/guides/django/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/).
- Logging with any logger creates breadcrumbs when the [Logging](/platforms/python/guides/logging/) integration is enabled, which is done by default.
