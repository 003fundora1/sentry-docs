<Note>

_Sentry's Next.js SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions._

</Note>

Features:

- Automatic [Error Tracking](/product/error-monitoring/) with Source Maps for both JavaScript and TypeScript
- Events [enriched](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- [Breadcrumbs](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) created for outgoing `http` request with XHR and Fetch; UI and system events; and console logs
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- Under the hood the SDK relies on our [React SDK](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) on the frontend and [Node SDK](/platforms/node) on the backend, which makes all functions available for React and Node also available in this SDK
- On Device symbolication for JavaScript (in Debug)
